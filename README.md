# Test_Project
Read numerical dates and translate them into dates but with words
Dates used are examples.
In order for this to work on your machine: change the dates in NDates to whatever you want, and change the file path to the corresponding one for your NDate file.
NDates and WDate.txt are simply example input and output files. Make your own NDate file and WDate will output correctly.
